# Bus-Sniffer
Creates a list of all the bus between a particular location so you can find the best deal

This is a ridiculus peice of code that scans through the intercity (or manabus) website to find cheap $1 busses.

It is a work in progress
Also its not my fault if intercity sues you. lol

##To Do

- Auto Stop after its scanned the alloted time frame
- Scan multiply routes in one go
- Give it a menu or make it a library (one or the other)
